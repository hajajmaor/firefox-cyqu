# 🔧 Fix: secInfo is undefined

## Problem
```
Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "pqProtectionStatus", secInfo is undefined
```

## Cause
You need to be on an **HTTPS page** first! secInfo is only available on secure connections.

## Solution

### Step 1: Navigate to HTTPS Site

In Firefox address bar, go to:
```
https://localhost:8443
```

### Step 2: Accept Certificate

Click "Advanced" → "Accept the Risk and Continue"

### Step 3: Wait for Page to Load

Make sure the page fully loads (you'll see the test page content)

### Step 4: NOW Test in Browser Console

Press `Ctrl+Shift+J` and run:

```javascript
// First check if we're on a secure connection
console.log("Location:", window.location.href);
console.log("Should be: https://localhost:8443");

// Get the current tab's security info
let browser = gBrowser.selectedBrowser;
let secInfo = browser.securityUI.secInfo;

// If still undefined, try this:
if (!secInfo) {
    secInfo = browser.securityUI.securityInfo;
}

// Now test
console.log("═══════════════════════════════════");
console.log("PQ Status:", secInfo.pqProtectionStatus);
console.log("PQ Message:", secInfo.pqStatusMessage);
console.log("Is Protected:", secInfo.isPQProtected);
console.log("═══════════════════════════════════");
```

### Alternative Test (More Reliable)

```javascript
// Get security info from current tab
let win = Services.wm.getMostRecentWindow("navigator:browser");
let browser = win.gBrowser.selectedBrowser;
let secInfo = browser.securityUI.securityInfo;

if (secInfo) {
    console.log("✅ Security Info Found!");
    console.log("PQ Status:", secInfo.pqProtectionStatus);
    console.log("Message:", secInfo.pqStatusMessage);
    console.log("Protected:", secInfo.isPQProtected);
} else {
    console.log("❌ No security info - are you on an HTTPS page?");
    console.log("Current URL:", browser.currentURI.spec);
}
```

## Expected Result

With self-signed cert (no PQ signatures):
```
PQ Status: pq-missing
Message: Classical cryptography only (no PQ signatures)
Protected: false
```

This is CORRECT! ✅ It means your PQ implementation is working - it correctly detects that the certificate doesn't have ML-DSA signatures.

## Why This Happens

- `secInfo` is only populated on **HTTPS connections**
- On `about:` pages or HTTP, it's undefined
- You MUST navigate to `https://localhost:8443` first

## Quick Fix

1. Type in address bar: `https://localhost:8443`
2. Press Enter
3. Accept certificate warning
4. Wait 2 seconds
5. NOW open Browser Console (Ctrl+Shift+J)
6. Run the test commands

✅ Should work now!
